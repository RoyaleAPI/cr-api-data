# cr-api-data

The Python scripts inside `/cr` combines columns inside several csv files to generate a collection of JSON files to be used for Clash Royale application development.

We try to update these files every time a client / balance update is released. The JSON files should be current.

**However**, you should note that `/json/cards_stats.json` is not complete as it would require some additional logic to flush it out. You are welcome to look into the source `/cr` folder and see if you can complete the logic and send us a pull request.
